[Shelly Cloud](https://shelly.cloud/) is a company developing IoT device for controling lights, plugs, roller and several sensor.
Each device hosts their own WebServer, so they don't need a Hub or a remote service to run.

This library aims to be a Python interface for interacting with such devices.
It allows controlling a device, and monitoring the state and power consumption of it.
